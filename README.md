# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code by Jon Cerruti
---
# Objective
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The starter code uses the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the Moment.js project status page.

# How the page work
This page has hours of a typical 9-5 work day. Each hour has a text area that you can type in tasks to be done every hour and a save button. The save button saves the tasks to local storage so that when page is refreshed the tasks are still available.
